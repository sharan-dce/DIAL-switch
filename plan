Architecture of system:

	Reward System:
			For each lost point, a reward of -1 will be given to both agents
			Otherwise, no reward will be given

	Functional Architecture of one network (agent):
		Input:
			Chunk of 100 x 100 x 2: Last two screen portions (last two time steps) -- 200 x 200 pixels in total: only a portion of which will be shown to each paddle
				So 100 x 100 x 2 will be the full input
			d: Apart from that, we have a message given to it, of d dimensions, which is directly fed to the fully connected part.

		Output:
			3: Q values: 3 Actions -- (no_op(0), up(1), down(2))
			k: One k dimensional output: the message to be passed to the global interpreter network

	Functional Architecture of central network:
		Input:
			k x NO_AGENTS: Inputs from the NO_AGENTS agents

		Output:
			d: d dimensional output to be broadcasted

We will use multiple agents, in this case 2 
Record current episode- backpropagation will take care of the rest
Study the correlation between the message exchanged and the input
